# App Deployment

The tag and snap pipelines of an app component include an additional build task that deploys the app's artifacts.

To snap and deploy your app, run the following:

<SnapApp />

To snap with a release version, and deploy your app, run the following:

<TagApp />

## Use a deployer

The Angular app plugin does not provide a default deployer.
Search [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) for a deployer, and set it in your app's plugin file.

For example:

<DeployerExample />

:::info Create a custom deployer
To create your own deployer, fork an existing deployer component or start from scratch.

## Deploy using your CI

You can choose to not use the deployment function and instead to deploy your app's artifacts using
your existing CI. For this, make sure to first disable you deployment function. After that you can
build your app component and look for the artifacts in the workspace capsule, or snap your app
component and extract the artifacts with this command:

<GetArtifacts />

The artifacts are now available in the new `build` directory at the root of your project.
Use this directory to deploy with your existing tools and workflows. For example:

<CiDeploy />
