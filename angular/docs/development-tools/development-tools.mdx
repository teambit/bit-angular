# Development Tools

## Dev Server - Angular Dev Server (Webpack)
The Angular env uses the dev server provided by the Angular CLI.
This dev server is based on Webpack and is configured to work with Bit.
The compilation of the source files is done by the Angular compiler (ngc) through a Webpack plugin.

If you use a custom env, you can configure both webpack and the Angular compiler by overriding the `getDevServer` method:
```ts
import { AngularV18Env } from '@bitdev/angular.envs.angular-v18-env';
import { AngularEnvOptions, BrowserOptions, DevServerOptions } from '@bitdev/angular.dev-services.common';
import { NgWebpackDevServer } from '@bitdev/angular.dev-services.webpack';
import { Configuration } from 'webpack';
import { DevServer, DevServerContext } from '@teambit/bundler';
import { WebpackConfigTransformer, WebpackConfigWithDevServer } from '@teambit/webpack';
import { AsyncEnvHandler } from '@teambit/envs';

export class MyAngularEnv extends AngularV18Env {
  // ...

  override getDevServer(
    devServerContext: DevServerContext,
    ngEnvOptions: AngularEnvOptions,
    transformers: WebpackConfigTransformer[] = [],
    angularOptions: Partial<BrowserOptions & DevServerOptions> = {},
    webpackOptions: Partial<WebpackConfigWithDevServer | Configuration> = {},
    sourceRoot?: string
  ): AsyncEnvHandler<DevServer> {
    return NgWebpackDevServer.from({
      angularOptions,
      devServerContext,
      ngEnvOptions,
      sourceRoot,
      transformers,
      webpackOptions
    });
  }
}

export default new MyAngularEnv();
```

The `angularOptions` are used to configure the Angular compiler (ngc), while the `webpackOptions` are used to configure the Webpack bundler.
Some webpack options may be overridden by the Angular CLI when it generates its own webpack configuration,
in which case you can use the `transformers` to override the webpack configuration after it was generated by the Angular CLI.

:::warning Proceed with caution
Modifying the webpack configuration may cause the dev server to stop working, so use it with caution.
:::

The full list of the Angular options and their default values can be found in the JSON schemas of the `@angular-devkit/build-angular` package:
- [browser options](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/builders/browser/schema.json)
- [dev-server options](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/builders/dev-server/schema.json)

The Webpack options can be found in the webpack documentation:
- [Webpack v5 configuration](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/) if you're using Angular v12 or above.
- [Webpack v4 configuration](https://v4.webpack.js.org/configuration/) if you're using Angular v11 or below.

:::tip Use intellisense
You can use intellisense in your IDE to see the list of options.

To learn how to use transformers, see [Webpack transformers documentation](reference/webpack/webpack-config#webpack-transformers).

## Compiler - Ng-Packagr & Angular Compiler (ngc)

The Angular env uses [ng-packagr](https://github.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr) to compile your component
source files into a distributable format. The compilation is done internally by the Angular compiler (ngc).
Ng-packagr is configured to work with Bit, and is automatically executed when you run `bit build`.

## Bundler - Webpack

Angular applications and compositions are bundled using Webpack. It is similar to the dev server,
but the options are optimized for production builds.

If you use a custom env, you can configure both webpack and the Angular compiler by overriding the `getBundler` method:
```ts
import { AngularV18Env } from '@bitdev/angular.envs.angular-v18-env';
import { AngularEnvOptions, BrowserOptions, DevServerOptions } from '@bitdev/angular.dev-services.common';
import { NgWebpackBundler } from '@bitdev/angular.dev-services.webpack';
import { Configuration } from 'webpack';
import { Bundler, BundlerContext } from '@teambit/bundler';
import { WebpackConfigTransformer, WebpackConfigWithDevServer } from '@teambit/webpack';
import { AsyncEnvHandler } from '@teambit/envs';

export class MyAngularEnv extends AngularV18Env {
  // ...

  override getBundler(
    bundlerContext: BundlerContext,
    ngEnvOptions: AngularEnvOptions,
    transformers: WebpackConfigTransformer[] = [],
    angularOptions: Partial<BrowserOptions & DevServerOptions> = {},
    webpackOptions: Partial<WebpackConfigWithDevServer | Configuration> = {},
    sourceRoot?: string
  ): AsyncEnvHandler<Bundler> {
    return NgWebpackBundler.from({
      angularOptions,
      bundlerContext,
      ngEnvOptions,
      sourceRoot,
      transformers,
      webpackOptions
    });
  }
}

export default new MyAngularEnv();
```

## Tester - Jest

The Angular env uses Jest as its default tester.

- To learn how to run Jest, see [Using Jest](#).
- To learn how to change the Jest configuration see [Configuration](#).
- To learn how to update the Jest version see [Update Jest version](#).
- For troubleshooting, see [Jest troubleshooting](#).
- To replace Jest with any other tester, see [Set a tester](#).

## Linter - ESLint

The Angular env use ESLint as its default linter.

- To learn how to run Jest, see [Using Jest](#).
- To learn how to change the Jest configuration see [Configuration](#).
- To learn how to update the Jest version see [Update Jest version](#).

## Formatter - Prettier

The Angular env use Prettier as its default formatter.

- To learn how to run Prettier, see [Using Prettier](#).
- To learn how to change the Prettier configuration see [Configuration](#).
- To learn how to update the Prettier version see [Update Prettier version](#).
