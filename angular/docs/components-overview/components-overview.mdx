# Overview

In some sense, [a Bit component](reference/components/component-anatomy) can be thought of as an Angular library. It is a collection of files that work together
to implement a feature (although, of course, a component is more than a collection of files). A component can include any type of Angular files, like components, directives,
services and pipes, as well as style files (CSS or SCSS) and test files.

A component has a single entry point, which is the main file that is used to import the component
into other components or applications. The entry point is a file named `public-api.ts` and
everything that is exported from this file will be available publicly.

A component in Bit also comes with a documentation file (.md) and a composition file that you can use
to render your components in different contexts and variations, allowing you to create showcases and
documentation for your components, similarly to what you would find in a component library.

The documentation file and the compositions are not part of the public api of the component, and are
not exported from the entry point.

## Create a component

There are different templates that you can use to create a component (see [Angular Component Generators](docs/angular-env/component-generators)).
The default template is the `ng-module` template, which creates a component with a single Angular module.

Run the following to create a component using your env's 'Angular' template:

<CreateComponent />

:::info Component compilation
Run Bit's development server (`bit start`) or watch mode (`bit watch`) to [compile](reference/compiling/compiler-overview)
modified components.

## Implementation file

Make your component as extensible as possible by using inputs and outputs. Extensibility is key to
maximizing component reuse.

```tsx
/* @filename: my-button.component.ts */

import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'my-button',
  template: `
    <button [ngClass]="cls">
      <ng-content></ng-content>
    </button>
  `,
  styleUrls: ['./my-button.component.scss'],
})
export class MyButtonComponent {
  @Input() cls: string;
}
```

## Main file

Expose your component's public API in the [component's main file](reference/components/component-main-file) (`public-api.ts`, by default):

```ts
/* @filename: public-api.ts */

/**
 * Entry point for this Angular library, do not move or rename this file.
 */
export * from './button.component';
export * from './button.module';
```

## Compositions

Verify that your component behaves as expected by rendering it in various relevant contexts and variations.

Since a composition is a mini-application that renders a component in a specific context and variation,
you can create a composition by exporting either a component, a module or a standalone component.

Exporting modules allows you to display multiple components on the same page by adding each component
to the `bootstrap` array of the module, and it is the recommended solution for Angular v13 and below.

Exporting a standalone component is more versatile, more aligned with how compositions behave, and
it contains less boilerplate, which is why it is the recommended solution for Angular v14 and above.

For example, the following basic composition displays the `ui/my-button` component with the text
`hello world!` and a custom class.

```ts
/* @filename: ui/my-button.composition.ts */
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { MyButtonModule } from './my-button.module';

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'my-button-composition-cmp',
  imports: [MyButtonModule],
  template: `MyButton composition:
    <my-button cls="my-style">hello world!</my-button>`,
})
export class MyButtonCompositionComponent {}
```

You can add other compositions by exporting additional components, from the same file or other
`*.composition.*` files.

Head to the component's 'Compositions' tab, to see your rendered compositions (run `bit start` if
you don't already have the workspace UI running).

## Tests

Head over to your component's `.spec.ts` file to add automated testing.
We recommend using unit test to test for your component files, and use your compositions in your
e2e tests. For example:

```tsx
import { ComponentFixture, TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';

import { MyButtonComponent } from './my-button.component';
import { MyButtonModule } from './my-button.module';

describe('MyButtonComponent', () => {
  let component: MyButtonComponent;
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<MyButtonComponent>;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      imports: [MyButtonModule],
    }).compileComponents();
  });

  beforeEach(() => {
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyButtonComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
    fixture.detectChanges();
  });

  it('should create', () => {
    expect(component).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

See the [Testing](reference/testing/tester-overview) docs for more information.

## Use a dependency

To use a dependency, whether it is a component or a package, install it in your workspace, and
import it into your component's files (components maintained in the same workspace do not need to be
installed, but are consumed via their package name, nonetheless).

To use a component as a dependency of another component, run `bit show ui/my-component` to see
its package name and use that to import it into other components.

## Documentation

A basic documentation file is automatically generated for your component when you use the one of
the templates. To add your own custom documentation, edit the existing `.md` documentation file in
your component directory.

## Collaborate

[Snap](/getting-started/collaborate/snap-component-changes) your component and
[export](/getting-started/collaborate/exporting-components) it to its remote scope to enable others
to consume it and collaborate on it.
