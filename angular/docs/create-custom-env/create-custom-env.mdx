# Set Up your Environment

An env (component development environment) provides your components with the proper tooling, configurations and runtime environment.
You can use one of the [pre-configured envs](https://bit.cloud/bitdev/angular/angular),
but we recommend creating a custom env for your workspace so that you can change the configurations and tooling to fit your needs.

## Create a custom Angular env

Run the following to create a new workspace that contains a custom Angular env component:

<NewWorkspace />

Alternatively, run the following to create a custom Angular env in an existing workspace:

<CreateEnv />

## Create a component pre-configured with an env

You can create components using pre-configured [generators](docs/angular-env/component-generators) (templates).
These generators include the source files for the component as well as its configuration.

Before you create a component using a generator, make sure that your custom env is set properly in your `workspace.jsonc` file.
When you set your env in the generator config you ensure that all (relevant) components that you generate will be configured to use that env.

```json
// @filename: workspace.jsonc
{
  "teambit.generator/generator": {
    "envs": ["my-org.my-scope/envs/my-angular-env"]
  }
}
```

Run the following command to list all available templates:

<BitTemplates />
<BitTemplatesOutput />

Generate a component using the `ng-module` template with the `bit create` command:

<CreateComponent />

Run the following command to verify that your component uses the proper env:

<BitEnvs />
<EnvsOutputComponent />

## Configure a component to use an env

You can set an existing component to use a different env at any time with the `bit envs set` command:

<SetEnv />
