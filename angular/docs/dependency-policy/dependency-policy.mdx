# Dependency Policy

The env dependency policy standardizes your component dependencies. That includes the dependencies
that you use for your component development, previewing, and runtime production.

See the section below to learn about alternative dependency configurations:

<DepManagementAlternatives isOutsideReferencePath />

The env dependency policy is great for standardizing your components' dependencies, but to set a
specific dependency configuration on a component or a group of components, use the
[dependency configuration](reference/dependencies/configuring-dependencies).

For example:

<DepsSet />

## Modifying the env dependency policy

You can modify your env dependencies by updating the `env.jsonc` file of your custom environment.
This will affect all components that use this environment.

For example, the following configuration sets `@angular/forms` version `^15.0.0`, as a peer dependency of your components:

```jsonc
// @filename: env.jsonc
{
  "policy": {
    "peers": [
      {
        "name": "@angular/forms",
        "version": "^15.0.0",
        "supportedRange": "^13.0.0 || ^14.0.0 || 15.0.0"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

When you set a dependency for an Angular **component**, you almost always want to use a peer dependency.
Your components will be used by other components or other applications, and you don't want to automatically install the dependency
with the component. Instead, you want to let the host application decide which version of the dependency to use.
Unlike regular dependency managers, Bit will automatically install peer dependencies using the version specified in the policy
if there is no other compatible version installed.
This is done to ensure that the component will work correctly locally (for preview, tests, ...).

When you set a dependency for an Angular **application**, you almost always want to use a runtime (regular) dependency.

The dev dependencies are used for development only. They are not used in the production code.
They can be used for testing, linting, building, etc.

Install the dependencies that you specified in your policy by running the following:

<BitInstall />

Verify that the installation was successful by inspecting your components' dependencies. For example:

<ShowComponent />

The output lists `@angular/forms` with the proper dependency type and version, [assuming this component uses it](#add-dependencies-forcefully):

<ShowComponentPeerOutput />

:::info Adding dependencies forcefully
By default, the dependency policy only affects components that use the dependencies listed in that policy.
To forcefully add a dependency, see the [Add dependencies forcefully](#add-dependencies-forcefully) section.
:::

### Add dependencies forcefully

By default, env dependencies only affect [components detected using the dependencies listed in the policy](reference/dependencies/dependency-policies#add-a-dependency-to-a-component).
For example, if the `ui/my-button` component does not include any `import ... from "@angular/forms"` statement , `@angular/forms` will not be added to its dependency graph.
The `force` property allows you to override this default behavior, and add a dependency to components that are not detected as using that dependency.

```jsonc
// @filename: env.jsonc
{
  "policy": {
    "peers": [
      {
        "name": "@angular/forms",
        "version": "^15.0.0",
        "force": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Remove dependencies forcefully

Use the `"-"` notation in combination with the `"force"` property, to remove dependencies from components.

For example, the following components uses the `themes/my-theme` component in its compositions file:

```tsx
// @filename: my-button.composition.ts

import { Component, NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { MyThemeModule } from '@my-org.design/themes/my-theme';
import { MyButtonModule } from '../my-button.module';

@Component({
  selector: 'composition-cmp',
  template: `<theme>...</theme>`,
})
class MyButtonCompositionComponent {}

@NgModule({
  declarations: [MyButtonCompositionComponent],
  imports: [MyButtonModule, MyThemeModule],
  bootstrap: [MyButtonCompositionComponent],
})
export class MyButtonCompositionModule {}
```

Bit automatically detects this dependency and resolves it as a dev dependency, since it is only used by a composition.

To forcefully remove this dependency as a dev dependency and configure it, instead, as a peer dependency, use the following config:

```jsonc
// @filename: env.jsonc
{
  "policy": {
    "dev": [
      {
        "name": "@my-org.design/themes/my-theme",
        "version": "-",
        "force": true
      }
    ],
    "peers": [
      {
        "name": "@my-org.design/themes/my-theme",
        "version": "0.0.2",
        "supportedRange": "0.0.2"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Peers

Peer dependencies are dependencies that are expected to be included in a component's host application.
They exist in just a single version.

When previewing components (docs and compositions) your env serves as your components' host application.
That makes every peer dependency of your component, a regular ("runtime") dependency of your env.

For example, the following configures `@angular/forms` as a peer dependency:

```jsonc
// @filename: env.jsonc
{
  "policy": {
    "peers": [
      {
        "name": "@angular/forms",
        /* the version to be used by the env */
        "version": "^15.0.0",
        /* the versions of @angular/forms your components are compatible with */
        "supportedRange": "^13.0.0 || ^14.0.0 || ^15.0.0"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Run the following to inspect the dependencies of your env:

<ShowEnv />

The output lists `@angular/forms` as a regular dependency, with version `^15.0.0`:

<ShowEnvOutput />

Run the following to inspect one of your components' dependencies:

<ShowComponent />

The output lists `@angular/forms` as a peer dependency, with a wide range of possible versions:

<ShowComponentPeerOutput />

## Dev

Dev dependencies are dependencies that are used by components solely for development.
Since they are not used at runtime, they are excluded from the production code of your components.

Dev dependencies such as type declaration packages (under the `@types` organization) aren't detected
by Bit as there are no corresponding `require`/`import` statements in the component files.
[To forcefully add them to the components' graph](#add-dependencies-forcefully), set their `"force"` property to `true`.

```jsonc
//  @filename: env.jsonc
{
  "policy": {
    "dev": [
      {
        "name": "@types/jest",
        "version": "^29.2.4",
        "hidden": true,
        "force": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

:::info Hiding dev dependencies
We recommend to set the dev dependencies' `"hidden"` property to `true` to hide them from Bit's dependency inspection tools,
unless you want to explicitly expose them to your users.
The standardized dev dependencies (such as `@types/...` deps) can be seen as superfluous information
for the maintainers of your components.
:::

### Configure files as dev files

Bit infers the type of dependency as a dev dependency when a component _only_ uses that dependency
in its [dev files](reference/components/dev-files).

You can configure a file as a dev file by adding its glob pattern to the `"patterns"` property in
your `env.jsonc` file.
This can be done by extending an existing array of glob patterns or by adding a new array.

```jsonc
// @filename: env.jsonc
{
  "patterns": {
    "compositions": ["**/*.composition.*", "**/*.preview.*"],
    "docs": ["**/*.docs.*"],
    "tests": ["**/*.spec.*", "**/*.test.*"],
    /* a custom array of dev file glob pattern */
    "my-dev-files": ["**/*.dev.*"]
  }
}
```

> Extending an array will not only set the file as a dev file but also as a file that is loaded by that specific dev service.

In the following example `lodash` is considered as a dev dependency as it is only consumed via this custom dev file:

```ts
// @filename: welcome.dev.ts

import _ from 'lodash';

export const isString = _.isString('hello');
```

Run the following command to inspect the dependencies of your component:

<ShowComponent />

The output includes `welcome.dev.ts` as a dev file, and its dependency, `lodash`, as a dev dependency:

<BitShowDevOutput />

## Runtime

Runtime dependencies (regular/production dependencies) are dependencies that are part of your production code.
In the Angular ecosystem, only apps have runtime dependencies (the exception is [the `tslib` package](https://angular.io/guide/migration-update-libraries-tslib)
which is always marked as a runtime dependency).
Components (also known as libraries in the Angular ecosystem) should always have peer dependencies.
As a safeguard, when you compile a component for production during build, `ng-packagr` will automatically
move your runtime dependencies to the `peerDependencies` section of your `package.json` file.

## Dependency resolver configuration

The devtools from Angular assume that you use `npm` or `yarn` as your dependency resolver.
They specifically do not support `pnpm`, which is the default dependency resolver for Bit.
The main issue is that `pnpm` uses a different structure for the `node_modules` folder, with a lot
of symlinks, which causes issues with `ngcc` (Angular's compatibility compiler).
If you use Angular v13 or above, you do not need to use `ngcc` and can use `pnpm` as your dependency manager.

If you are using Angular v12 or below, you can still use `pnpm` as your dependency manager by configuring
your `workspace.jsonc` file with the `nodeLinker` property set to `hoisted`:

```jsonc
  "teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
    "packageManager": "teambit.dependencies/pnpm",
    "nodeLinker": "hoisted",
    "policy": {
      // ...
    }
  },
```

In this case, `pnpm` will not use symlinks and will default to yarn's structure for the `node_modules`
folder, which is compatible with `ngcc`. However, it will be significantly slower than usual.

## Choose the correct version for your dependencies

Angular libraries are generally released for a specific version of Angular. It is important that
you choose the correct version for the external libraries that you install. For example, if you
install `@angular/forms` v15, it will not work with Angular v13. And that is the same for
community libraries. For example, if you install `@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap`, you must refer to
the compatibility table to see which version is compatible with your version of Angular
(for a project using Angular v15, you should install `@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap` version 14.x.x).

This doesn't mean that your Angular components are limited to a specific version of Angular. If you
know that your code doesn't use any Angular v15-specific APIs, you can set the `supportedRange`
property to `^13.0.0 || ^14.0.0 || ^15.0.0` to allow your components to be used with any of these
Angular versions.

In general, there are very few major Angular versions that have major breaking changes that affect
the components. For example, Angular v13 introduced a new module format based on ESM and dropped
commonjs support. Because of this, we made the choice to drop ngcc (Angular's compatibility compiler)
in Angular v13 and above. Ngcc was used to make libraries that have not been compiled with Ivy compatible
with Ivy, but it has a significant performance impact and is causing issues with pnpm.
This means that if you use Angular v13, you should probably restrict your components
to be used only with Angular v13 packages and above.

## Configuring your env to use external libraries

Some libraries (mostly theme libraries) require you to configure your Angular app to use them.
For example, if you use `@angular/material`, you need to configure your app to use the
`@angular/material` styles. Outside of Bit, this is done by adding the `@angular/material` package
to the `styles` array in your `angular.json` file, but Bit doesn't use this file. Instead, you have
different options depending on what you are trying to achieve:

- For composition styles, we usually recommend creating a _theme component_ that will be used to wrap
  your compositions and simplify maintenance and reusability. See [Theming](docs/angular-design/theming)
  for more information.

- Another possibility is to configure your custom environment and change the Angular options directly
  into the `getDevServer` method for the local preview, or in the `getBundler` method for the remote
  artefacts that will be visible on bit.cloud. This will allow you to use styles and scripts that will
  be available for all of your components that use this custom env. See [Development Tools](docs/angular-env/development-tools)
  for more information on how to configure the dev server and the bundler.

- Finally, If you are trying to use the library for your applications, you can configure those options
  directly in the config file of your application by changing the `angularServeOptions` and
  `angularBuildOptions` properties. See [App dev server](docs/angular-apps/create-ng-app) for more
  information.
