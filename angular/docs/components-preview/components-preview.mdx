# Components Preview

The preview is a way to display the documentation and the compositions of a component.
You can override the preview method of your [custom env](docs/angular-env/use-custom-env#create-a-custom-angular-env)
to customize how your docs and compositions are bundled and rendered:

```ts
// @filename: my-angular-env.bit-env.ts
import { AngularV19Env } from '@bitdev/angular.envs.angular-v19-env';
import { Preview } from '@teambit/preview';
import { EnvHandler } from '@teambit/envs';
import { AngularPreview } from '@bitdev/angular.dev-services.preview.preview';

export class MyAngularEnv extends AngularV19Env {
  preview(): EnvHandler<Preview> {
    return AngularPreview.from({
      /* preview config goes here */
    });
  }
}

export default new MyAngularEnv();
```

> A component's preview configuration does not affect production code.

## Configuration

The preview handles both the dev server and the bundler.
You can configure both of them independently, see
[Development Tools - Dev server](docs/angular-env/development-tools#dev-server---angular-dev-server-(webpack))
and [Development Tools - Bundler](docs/angular-env/development-tools#bundler---webpack) for more information.

## Compositions

You can render your components in different contexts and variations with _compositions_,
which are displayed in the `Compositions` tab.

### Composition files glob pattern

Update the glob patterns listed in the `env.jsonc` file of your custom env to determine which files,
in a component's directory, should be loaded as compositions.

```json
{
  "patterns": {
    "compositions": [
      "**/*.composition.*",
      "**/*.preview.*",
      "**/*.my-custom-pattern.*"
    ]
  }
}
```

> Since compositions are only used for development, every composition file is considered as a _dev file_.
> A single component can have multiple composition files.

### Compositions providers

Your components might require a certain context to function properly, or to better simulate their
behavior in possible host applications.

We recommend using "wrapper" components in your compositions to avoid repeating the same code and to
standardize your compositions' "playground".

#### Angular v14 and above

The simplest solution to build a wrapper is to use a standalone component to project the composition
in an `<ng-content>` element. Setting `ViewEncapsulation.None` on the wrapper component removes the
scope of your wrapper styles and lets your composition inherit the wrapper's styles.
You can also use `:host ::ng-deep` in your theme styles to affect all descendant elements.

The following example wraps every composition with a theme provider:

<CompositionProviderExample />


#### Angular v13 and below
If you are using an old version of Angular that doesn't have standalone components, you can use
a regular component. It will automatically be transformed into a web component that dynamically embeds
your content into its shadow dom:

<CompositionProviderExample2 />

#### Host dependencies
Just like other peer dependencies used for component previewing, you should include composition
providers only once in the bundle of your env and exclude them from the preview bundle of your components.
You can do that by configuring the `hostDependencies` property of your preview. For example:

```ts
import { AngularV19Env } from '@bitdev/angular.envs.angular-v19-env';
import { Preview } from '@teambit/preview';
import { EnvHandler } from '@teambit/envs';
import { AngularPreview } from '@bitdev/angular.dev-services.preview.preview';

export class MyAngularEnv extends AngularV19Env {
  preview(): EnvHandler<Preview> {
    return AngularPreview.from({
      mounterPath: require.resolve('./config/mounter'),
      hostDependencies: [
        /* your composition provider */
        '@my-scope/my-theme.provider',
        /* make sure to include the following dependencies that are used for the preview, as well */
        '@teambit/mdx.ui.mdx-scope-context',
        '@mdx-js/react',
        'react',
        'react-dom',
      ],
    });
  }
}
```

#### Other options

The mounter component has a few other options that you can use to customize the way your compositions
 are rendered.

You can pass the `hostElement` property to the `createMounter` function to specify the element that
will be used to mount your compositions in your index.html file. For example:

```ts
import { createMounter } from '@bitdev/angular.dev-services.preview.mounter';
import { WrapperModule } from './wrapper';

const ngApp = document.getElementById('ng-app');
export default createMounter(WrapperModule, {hostElement: ngApp});
```

Finally, the `appConfig` property of the `createMounter` function lets you define some providers that
will be available in your compositions (see [the Angular documentation](https://angular.io/api/platform-browser/ApplicationConfig)). For example:

```ts
import { ApplicationConfig } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { createMounter } from '@bitdev/angular.dev-services.preview.mounter';
import { WrapperModule } from './wrapper';

const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    {provide: BACKEND_URL, useValue: 'https://yourdomain.com/api'}
  ]
};
export default createMounter(WrapperModule, {appConfig});
```
