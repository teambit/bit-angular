# Build Pipelines

A build pipeline is a sequence of tasks that are executed when a component is built or snapped.

Your env defines the build tasks that will be executed on your components.
These tasks are then included into a series of core build tasks that are common to all components.

Run the following command to execute the build pipeline:

<BitBuild />

Run the following command to execute the [snap pipeline](docs/getting-started/collaborate/snap-component-changes) (which includes the build pipeline):

<BitSnap />

Run the following command to execute the [tag pipeline](#) (which includes the build pipeline):

<BitTag />

## Review a component's pipelines

Run the following command to review the pipelines of a component:

<ListTasks />

You will get a list of tasks that includes core tasks (like `CoreExporter`), and tasks that your env
registered (such as `NgMultiCompiler`).

<ListTasksOutput />

:::info Build artifacts
Most build tasks generate artifacts. Learn how to retrieve and handle the generated artifacts in
[Build artifacts](reference/build-pipeline/build-artifacts).

## Env services vs build tasks

When you developer a component you will run env services _in your workspace_, such as `tester`,
`linter`, and so on.
You can execute those services manually by using the corresponding commands (e.g, `bit test`),
or automatically when running Bit's development server (`bit start`).

Build tasks, on the other hand, run _in a [capsule](reference/build-pipeline/capsule)_, a directory
isolated from the workspace. They are executed when a component is built/snapped/tagged (`bit build`, `bit snap` or `bit tag`).

Most development tools provide an env service and a corresponding build task. For example,
`Jest` provides the tester env service and the test build task.

<JestTabs />

:::info Preview service
An exception to the service/build-task pattern above is the `preview` service.
It is part of Bit's core build tasks and runs for every component when you build/snap/tag it.
To learn more see [Component previews](docs/angular-env/components-preview).

## Modify a pipeline

### Replace a task

Instead of replacing the entire build pipeline, you can just replace a task in it.
The following example replaces the default `Jest` build task with the same task, but with a different configuration.

```ts
// @filename: my-angular-env.bit-env.ts
// ...
import { AngularV18Env } from '@bitdev/angular.envs.angular-v18-env';
import { JestTask } from '@teambit/defender.jest-tester';

export class MyAngularEnv extends AngularV18Env {
  build() {
    /* replace the default Jest build task with a new one, that uses a different config */
    return super.build().replace([
      JestTask.from({
        jest: require.resolve('jest'),
        config: require.resolve('./configs/new.jest.config')
      })
    ]);
  }
}

export default new MyAngularEnv();
```

Verify that your pipelines were modified properly by [reviewing the component's pipelines](#review-a-component's-pipelines).

### Add a task

By default, the Angular env only registers tasks for the build pipeline.
However, you can add your own tasks to a new snap and tag pipelines as well.

<AddBuildTabs />

To learn how to create a custom task, see [Create a build task](reference/build-pipeline/implement-build-task).

### Remove a task

To remove a task from a pipeline, use the `remove()` method in the relevant pipeline(`build`, `snap` or `tag`).
Get the task name from [the component's list of build tasks](#review-a-component's-pipelines).

```ts
// @filename: my-angular-env.bit-env.ts
// ...
import { AngularV18Env } from '@bitdev/angular.envs.angular-v18-env';

export class MyAngularEnv extends AngularV18Env {
  build() {
    return super.build().remove('JestTask');
  }
}

export default new MyAngularEnv();
```
