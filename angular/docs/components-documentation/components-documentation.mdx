# Components Docs

The components' 'Overview' tab displays the documentation of your components.
A component's documentation describes the function and purpose of the component and instructs on how to use it.

### Doc files glob pattern

Update the glob patterns listed in the `env.jsonc` file of your custom env to determine which files,
in a component's directory, should be loaded as docs.

```json
{
  "patterns": {
    "docs": ["**/*.docs.*", "**/*.readme.*"]
  }
}
```

> Since docs are only used for development, every docs file is considered as a _dev file_.
> A single component cannot have more than a single docs file.

### Docs App & mdx files
Since mdx files only support React components, Bit uses a custom Angular app to render your docs
and load them as regular md files. The specificities of mdx files cannot be supported in the Angular app.
Unfortunately, this means that you cannot use Angular components in your documentation.

For the moment, there is no simple way to replace the Angular app that renders documentation.
