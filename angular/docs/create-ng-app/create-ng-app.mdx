# Create apps

An app is a component that can be served, built and deployed. Naturally, apps have dependencies
(components and packages) but no dependents. For example, the React `bit-dev` component is an app.
It uses `ui/community-docs`, a standard Bit React component, as a dependency:

<AppGraph />

## Run an app locally

Run the following command to list all available apps in your workspace:

<ListApps />

The output lists the IDs of the available app components and their corresponding app names:

<ListAppsOutput />

Run the following to run an app locally, independent of Bit's dev server:

<RunApp />

After building the app bundle, the dev server will list the path and port of your app:

<RunAppOutput />

## Create a new app component

Run the following command to create an app using the `ng-app` template of your env:

<CreateApp />

The output displays the ID of the generated app (component):

<CreateNgAppOutput />

The generated app component includes an [app plugin file](reference/apps/application-plugins), `my-app.ng-app.ts`,
with a file pattern that is detected by its corresponding [application-type](reference/apps/application-types),
in this case the Angular app-type.
Use a different plugin file pattern to switch from Bit's official Angular app-type, to a different app-type.
This will affect how your app is being served, built and deployed.

<NgAppDir />

Install the app's dependencies with the following command:
<InstallDeps/>
