# Bit Angular

This scope contains the different components used to support the Angular framework.
You can get more information about Bit & Angular in [the Bit Angular documentation](https://bit.dev/docs/angular-introduction).


## Getting started
Run the following command to create a new workspace that contains a custom Angular env component:
```
bit new angular my-workspace --aspect bitdev.angular/angular-env
```

You can list all available templates with the following command:
```
bit templates
```

Generate a component using the ng-standalone template with the bit create command:
```
bit create ng-standalone ui/my-button
```

Run the following command to create and set up an application using the ng-app template:
```
bit create ng-app apps/my-angular-app
```


## Structure
- `app-types`: adds support for Angular applications
- `dev-services`: the different tools used by the Angular envs such as the compilers, linter, preview, etc...
- `docs`: the components used by the [the Bit Angular documentation](https://bit.dev/docs/angular-introduction)
- `envs`: the Angular environments for each major version of the framework that we support
- `examples`: the components used by the templates
- `templates`: the templates for the starters and generators
- `angular-env`: the default Angular environment. It uses the latest version of the framework


## Features
The following dev services are supported by default:
- Jest
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Webpack dev server & bundler
- ESBuild / Vite dev server for apps, with SSR support
- Ng-packagr for libraries
- Angular elements


## Supported versions
The Angular team releases a new major version every 6 months.
The [default Angular env](https://bit.cloud/bitdev/angular/angular-env) always uses the latest stable version of Angular and its dependencies.

Bit will still support old versions of Angular when possible,
if you want to use a specific version, you can use one of those env versions instead:
- v19: bitdev.angular/envs/angular-v19-env (latest)
- v18: bitdev.angular/envs/angular-v18-env (LTS)
- v17: bitdev.angular/envs/angular-v17-env (LTS)
- v16: bitdev.angular/envs/angular-v16-env (LTS)
- v15: bitdev.angular/envs/angular-v15-env (deprecated)
- v14: bitdev.angular/envs/angular-v14-env (deprecated)
- v13: bitdev.angular/envs/angular-v13-env (deprecated)

Read [the Bit Angular documentation](https://bit.dev/docs/angular-env/angular-versions) for more information about the different versions.
